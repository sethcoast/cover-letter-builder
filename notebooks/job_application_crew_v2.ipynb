Methods This study involved 22 students (21 male, 1 female) in a large urban high school in the North Eastern United States. The school is one of the most diverse schools in the US (25% Asian, 23% Hispanic, 20% Black/African American, and 29% White), and 61% of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Using a comput ational action approach ( Tissenbaum, Sheldon & Abelson, 2019 ), the students took part in a 12 -week curriculum in which they used MIT App Inventor – a blocks -based programming language that allows students to build fully native Android mobile apps without needing to learn the syntax of code – to develop apps that ha d direct impacts in their community. For this study, students built apps aimed to help clean and bring awareness to pollution issues of a large river running\n",

      "of those, fewer than 3,000 were women. Just 7% of workers in computing in 2014 identified as Black and 7% as Hispanic (Beckhusen, 2016). Clearly, the challenge we face is not only to encourage more people to engage in computing, but also to ensure that the diversity of our community is reflected in the field. To address this challenge, many suggest introducing students to Computer Science (CS) well before college. However, bringing computational thinking (CT) into K- 12 contexts comes with its own potential challenges. Without careful attention to pedagogy and design, we might ultimately teach computational thinking in schools in ways that exacerbate current trends, contributing to the same K- 12 participation gaps in interest and identity that we see in other STEM related fields. Thus, it is imperative that we look to the lessons learned about designing for equitable participation in these other fields as we seek to understand how to connect CS to K -12 contexts.
